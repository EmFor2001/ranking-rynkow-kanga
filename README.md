## Getting Started
### There is no CORS error fix in this version so it can only be opened with the browser in no security mode

First, install the dependencies: 

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
